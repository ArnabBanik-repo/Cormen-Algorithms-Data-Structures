# Bubble sort

## Algorithm

Bubble sort algorithm works by iterating through each element of a list and comparing each pair of elements and
switching their positions if necessary so that the largest value is positioned at the end of the list. When the largest value is positioned in the Nth position, the algorithm will only iterate through the (N-1)th position.

##### Running time:
  - Worst case performance       O(n^2)
  - Best case performance        O(n)
  - Average case performance     O(n^2)

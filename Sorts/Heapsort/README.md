# Heap sort

## Algorithm

Heapsort algorithm use a data structure ("heap") to manage information. More specifically, we use max-heaps so the largest element is stored at the root. Here is a figure of a max-heap viewed as (a) a binary tree and (b) an array.

#### Running time :

  - Worst case perfomance : O(n log n)
  - Best case perfomance : O(n log n)
  - Average case perfomance : O(n log n)

#### Pros and cons:

- Heapsort combines the better attributes of the merge sort(running time is O(n lg n)) and of the insertion sort(sorts in place).
